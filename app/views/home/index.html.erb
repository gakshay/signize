		Even though "lorem ipsum" often arouses curiosity because of its resemblance to classical Latin, it is not intended to have meaning. Where text is comprehensible in a document, people tend to focus on the textual content rather than upon overall presentation, so publishers use lorem ipsum when displaying a typeface or design elements and page layout in order to direct the focus to the publication style and not the meaning of the text.[2] In spite of its basis in Latin, use of lorem ipsum is often referred to as greeking, from the phrase "it's all greek to me" which indicates that this is not meant to be readable text.
